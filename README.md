# MECA - A Mobile-Efficient Consultation App

CCS Mobile Efficient Consultation App - A Mobile app to provide easy consultation between students and faculty of TSU College of Computer Studies.

### I.	PURPOSE
Students often look for guidance from a professor through requesting for consultation time.  This can be related to their performance in class, capstone/thesis concerns, or other academic-related concerns that involve a faculty member or professor’s inputs.
In Tarlac State University - College of Computer Studies, faculty consultations are requested mainly for case studies or project-related concerns, wherein the faculty member consults an individual or a small group of students upon agreeing on a scheduled request by the said students.  
The project titled “A Mobile-Efficient Consultation Application for Tarlac State University – College of Computer Studies” general purpose is to provide a more efficient and reliable method to requesting, tracking and delivering consultation requests.

### II.	PROBLEM
The college currently uses a printed consultation slip provided by the Office of the Dean for students to officially request for consultation time from their target faculty members.  One of the issues during the process is that there it is possible that the target faculty member is not currently in their office for reasons such as they are absent, or they are currently in class.
Another issue is that students may not be aware of the faculty member’s consultation time, which is posted outside the faculty office, but may not be updated.  There may also be some cases wherein faculty members are not available even during their specified consultation hours and students would not be aware.
 

### III.	SOLUTION
The project provides features that will mitigate the above potential problems within the consultation request process by compiling the necessary requirements and information into one mobile app.  This proposal intends to provide a more enhanced process aside from the original consultation request process.
A student who has the mobile app installed to their Android or iOS mobile device will be able to log in using their TSU Office 365 account, check the faculty member’s availability and request for consultation time by inputting the necessary details of their request.  These details include information such as the date & time and purpose.
Faculty members (mainly professors and instructors) are able to log into the mobile app using their Office 365 accounts as well and are able to receive notifications and reminders of their pending and accepted consultation requests.  Upon accepting or declining a request, a notification will be sent to the student to inform them of their consultation request status.
The mobile application intends to be useable even without a connection to the internet by using a real-time database, wherein the mobile application is completely serverless and locally caches all data to their devices.  For example, if a faculty member receives a new request while online, it will be cached to their mobile device automatically so that they can still view the request later while offline.
Any actions in the mobile app (such as approving/declining requests) that are done offline will also be cached and executed automatically when the mobile device is connected to the internet in the future.
